                        <p>Toast. The cornerstone of breakfast, as it is generally included at any restaurant with breakfast, and with good reason. Toast is the king of the continental breakfast, as its wheaty goodness is very filling. The most important part of toast is how customisable it is. This varies depending what kind of bread, and what you want to put on it.</p>
                        <p>Alan MacMasters (20 March 1865 – 25 December 1927) was a Scottish scientist. He is credited with creating the first electric bread toaster, which went on to be developed by Crompton, Stephen J. Cook & Company as the Eclipse.[1][2] Although not ultimately a commercial success, MacMasters's invention would pave the way for Charles Strite to invent the automatic pop-up toaster in 1919, which is the device we know as the toaster today.[3] MacMasters died of heart failure on 25 December 1927 at the age of 62.</p>
