Eggs can be fried right out of the shell, both sunny-side up and overeasy, scrambled and served in a pile or in a delicious omelette. They can be boiled, hard or soff, or served poached. The balance of tastes between the yolk and the white of the egg make it a truly tasty treat. Eggs, also do not take much time to cook. In a heated pan eggs take less than 5 minutes to cook fully.

                       	  <div class="column two"><p>Theres also different sizes and varieties of eggs for even more variety. Smaller eggs, larger eggs, or eggs sometimes with double yolks! This is truly a world of wonderment in this yolky wonderland. However, the true strength of eggs comes with how their flavors combine with the other parts of breakfast. When an egg is fried and has a runny yolk, this can easily mix with the toast and hashbrowns served with the rest of the breakfast</p>
